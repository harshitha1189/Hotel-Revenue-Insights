# Hotel-Revenue-Insights

## Overview
AtliQ Grands is a chain of five-star hotels spread across India, with a legacy of 20 years in the hospitality industry. Due to increased competition and ineffective management decision-making, the company has been losing market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel segment. To regain market share and optimize revenue, the Managing Director has decided to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence" into their operations.

Since AtliQ Grands lacks an in-house data analytics team, they have hired a third-party service provider to extract insights from their historical data to aid in their decision-making processes.
